# Candidate-Resume-Filtering

1. Project Description: This project involves building a KNN classifier to filter job candidate resumes based on their qualifications and skills.

2. Data Collection: The project involves collecting job candidate resumes and extracting relevant information such as skills, qualifications, and experience.

3. Data Preprocessing: The collected data is then preprocessed by removing irrelevant information, converting text data into numerical data, and normalizing the data.

4. Feature Extraction: Next, features are extracted from the preprocessed data. Features such as skills, qualifications, and experience are extracted from the candidate resumes.

5. KNN Classifier: A KNN classifier is then trained on the extracted features. The KNN classifier uses the distance between the features of the candidate resumes and the features of the job requirements to classify the candidate resumes.

6. Evaluation: The accuracy of the KNN classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. Deployment: The trained KNN classifier is then deployed to filter job candidate resumes based on their qualifications and skills.

8. Future Work: Further improvements can be made to the KNN classifier by using other classification algorithms or by including more features in the classification model. The project can also be extended to other domains such as academic admissions or scholarship screening.
